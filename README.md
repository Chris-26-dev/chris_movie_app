## üí° Why I Built This
I wanted to create a mobile app that goes beyond just listing movies. Many movie apps show trending films based on external sources, but I wanted **personalized popularity**‚Äîranking movies based on actual **user interaction inside the app**. This makes recommendations feel more relevant and community-driven.

---

## üõ† Problems I Solved
- **Lack of personalized trending data:**  
  Instead of pulling only external "popular" lists, the app tracks in-app **reactions** and dynamically updates rankings.
- **Disconnected reaction data:**  
  I implemented a **Save Screen** to give users a central place to revisit all movies they‚Äôve interacted with.
- **Seamless real-time updates:**  
  The integration with Appwrite ensures the popularity rankings and saved movies update instantly.

## üìö What I Learned
- Building and integrating a **custom popularity algorithm** with a backend service (Appwrite)
- Implementing **real-time data synchronization** in a mobile app
- Designing **scalable UI architecture** with reusable components
- Styling mobile apps using **Tailwind CSS principles in NativeWind**
- Improving TypeScript skills for type safety and maintainability
